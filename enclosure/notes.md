## Description of Materials, Design Decisions, and Battery

Design Decisions: The core design concept for this project is inspired by the pyramid, a shape that symbolizes stability, focus, and energy convergence. All essential components, including the ESP32, MPU6050 sensor, button, LED, switch, and batteryâ€”are embedded within the grippable section of the pyramid for compactness and ease of use.

Material: 3D printing

Power: For power, I used the Adafruit 3.7V 350
